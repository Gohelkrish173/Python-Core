imp properties of random module:

random() => use to generate random number
seed() => save the state of the random function,and it return same value that could be saved
randint(start,end) => give a random int number in given range
randrange(start,stop,step) => give a random int number created by start,stop,step
choice(list) => give a random value from the list
shuffle(list) => randomly reorder the element
uniform(start,stop) => generate random floating point number between this numbers

-----------------------------------------

imp properties of Math module:

-> constants

	1)Euler's Number -> math.e
	2)Pi -> math.pi
	3)Tau -> math.tau
	4)infinity -> math.inf
	5)Not a Number(NaN) -> math.nan

ceil(float_variable) => give a smaller int number of given float number
floor(float_variable) => give a gretest int number of given float number
factorial(int) => give a factorial of given number
gcd(int,int) => find a gcd of the given numbers
fabs(int) => function give a absolute value ex. n = -15 and absolute value is 15
exp(x) => e power x
power(a,b) => a is base and b is power (a**b)
log([x,base]) => x is value and base is log base
log2(x) => x is value of log base 2
log10(x) => x is value of log base 10
sqrt(x) => sqrt of x
sin(x) => sine of x radians.
cons(x) => cos of x radians.
tan(x) => tan of x radians.
degree(x) => x from radians to degree.
radians(x) => x from degree to radians.
gamma(x) => gamma value of x.
isinf(x) => infinity or not.
isnan(x) => NaN or not.
erf(x) -> return error function of x.

-----------------------------------------

imp properties of Date module:

datetime.now() as dt => corrent date ex. datetime.datetime.now() -> today date
dt.year => provide year of that date
dt.day => provide day of that date
dt.month => provide month of that date
dt.hour => provide hour of that time
dt.year => provide minute of that time
dt.timestamp() => provide timestamp of that time
dt.timedalta(month or day or year or times for calculate with other date) => manipulate difference of dates

Date_formate :-

strftime(String) and strptime(String) 
=> convert date in string which is formate set by user -> ex. strf("%A %m %-Y %-l %p etc.") (% and - is create a formate of string)
